# White-Lotus-Resort-MockUp

Mock-up page for a resort webpage

This project is designed to showcase an imaginary resort. It was built with a mobile-first approach. It is easy to navigate with a hamburger menu in the mobile, and a fixed nav in the desktop version.
The page aims to transport emotion to the user with little text and carefully chosen pictures.
The design is clean and has an easy-going, yet dynamic flow.

This project is my own and not based on a tutorial.
