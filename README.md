# White-Lotus-Resort-MockUp
Mock-up page for a resort webpage

This project is designed to showcase an imaginary resort. It is easy to navigate with a hamburger menu in the mobile,
and a fixed nav in the desktop version. 
The page aims to transport emotion to the user with little text and carefully chosen pictures. 
The design is clean and has an easy-going, yet dynamic flow. 

This project is my own.
